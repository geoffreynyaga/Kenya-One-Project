This is an opensource project that was conceived in the Aerospace Department at the Technical University of Kenya. This project was initially used for the conceptual and detailed design.

However, now it is being modified to be used for other types of General Aviation and Light Drone aircraft design. Hopefully soon there will be modules to work on Large Aircrafts and possibly Airships.

> The main idea is that we can have a software that aggregrates all sizing, performance, weight estimation, cost analysis, Drag etc into one platform and reduce over-reliance on fragmented excel, matlab/octave, fortran scripts and incorporate modern visualisation and optimisation into the workflow.

> #### Inspiration is derived from works of many great engineers and authors including but not limited to:
>
> - Prof. Snorri Gudmundsson
> - Dr. Raymer
> - Prof. Sadraey
> - Nicolai
> - Roskam
> - Ajoy Kumar Kundu etc

### Work in progress

- Integrating Electron Framework to build GUI for Windows, MacOS and Linux environments
- Sharing the React Code with Electron and Web frontend.
- Django backend to store the data.
- Deploy the backend so that values can be synce across devices.

I invite anyone with any ideas to collaborate and add features.
